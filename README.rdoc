== The Bug

If capybara/rspec is required before rspec/rails in your spec_helper.rb file, then you will
be unable to use the capyabara `visit` method in a request spec unless it is nested inside a
second describe block. See the lone request spec for a reproduction.

Interestingly, it seems unnecessary to require capybara/rspec at all. If I remvoe that entirely,
the tests pass. They also pass if I require rspec/rails first.
